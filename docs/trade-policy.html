<p>In agriculture, strongly divergent climatic conditions around the globe create ideal conditions for making use of comparative advantage in production. And while it would seem that free trade should be particularly attractive and relevant in agriculture, it has been traditionally an area where governments of high income countries as well as those of low and middle income countries have exercises certain degree of protectionism, i.e., they have been reluctant to open up domestic markets to international trade.</p>
<div id="free-trade-vs.-protectionism" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Free Trade vs. Protectionism</h2>
<p>The case for free trade is that producers and consumers allocate resources most efficiently when governments do not distort market prices through trade policy. Economic welfare of a (small) country is the highest with free trade. With restricted trade, consumers, on average, pay higher prices than they would otherwise, i.e., with free trade, as well as firms produce more of the output somewhat inefficiently.</p>
<p>Protectionism consists of a set of barriers to trade that deviates the trade patterns from what would have been their state in absence of any regulations (i.e., in a free trade regime). In high income countries, the case for protectionism is primarily directed to distribute benefits to producers, to maintain a considerable degree of self–sufficiency, and, in the case of large countries, to achieve the more favorable terms of trade.</p>
<p>In low and middle income countries, barriers to trade are imposed in attempts to distribute benefits to particular groups, to generate government revenues, and to offset economic instability and food insecurity. In addition to these self-imposed restrictions, low and middle income countries can also be affected by externally imposed protectionist policies of the high income countries.</p>
<p>Common levers for a trade restriction are trade quotas, as well as import tariffs and export taxes. The quotas, such as export restrictions, tend to be imposed by some countries somewhat intermittently, during the years with a bad harvest season, or during periods of abnormally high prices for food commodities, for example. Tariffs and taxes are considered less distorting than quotas, and thus are more common longer-term application to trade restrictions. Other government interventions that can still impact/distort trade, albeit to a lesser extent, are various taxes and subsidies, such as, for example, income taxes, value-added taxes, production subsidies, etc.</p>
<!-- ## Reducing Instability -->
<!-- Trade policy often is motivated by a desire to stabilize prices---i.e., reduce price variability---rather than to necessarily keep prices beyond (above or below) some level. In any case, whether it is the aim or the by-product, governments' involvement in trade affairs tend to result in less volatile commodity prices.  Of course, the two are typically Many trade policy issues are related to price variability rather than average price levels for traded goods and foreign exchange earnings. Some of the main strategies used to address price risk include: diversification, commodity agreements, compensatory financing, enhanced use of market information, and temporary export restrictions. -->
<div id="the-terms-of-trade" class="section level3" number="5.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> The Terms of Trade</h3>
<p>The <em>terms of trade</em> denotes export prices in terms of import prices. A large country can alter terms of trade in their favor by means of trade restrictions (e.g., tariffs or quotas) or other equivalent trade distortion mechanisms. The welfare effect of this is nonlinear, however. That is, a small tariff may lead to an increase in national welfare, but at some tariff rate, the welfare will begin to decrease as the economic efficiency loss exceeds the terms of trade gain. Likewise, an export tax that completely prohibits exports leaves a country worse off; but an export tax rate may exist that maximizes national welfare through the terms of trade. This, of course, ignores the possibility that other countries may retaliate against the large country by enacting their own trade restrictions.</p>

<div id="the-general-agreement-on-tariffs-and-trade" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</h2>
<p>After the World War II, nations around the world recognized the urgent need for coordinated policy efforts in the areas of economic development, monetary policy, and international trade. The focus shifted from bilateral to multilateral negotiations. With that in mind—and after the United States Congress refused to sign on an agreement reached by the Bretton Woods participants to form the International Trade Organization—23 nations signed a multilateral agreement regulating international trade known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva on 30 October 1947 to take effect on 1 January 1948.</p>
<p>The GATT replaced a series of bilateral agreements that segmented world trade before the war. The agreement became the vehicle for trade negotiations for the next half century, until its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO), was formed and took effect in 1995. In the meantime, eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations took place under the GATT.</p>
<p>The early rounds primarily focused on negotiations on tariffs and on rules for trading blocs; the middle rounds increasingly focused on non-tariff issues. Agricultural trade restrictions received relatively little attention until the <em>Uruguay Round</em>, which commenced in 1986. Prior to this, high income countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture. Subsequently, a compromise was reached by guaranteeing farmers continued support, and allowing subsidies, that cause not more than minimal trade distortion, to meet public policy aims. Agricultural trade restrictions were at the heart of the <em>Doha Round</em>, also called the <em>Development Round</em>, under the WTO.</p>
<!-- Main principles of the GATT involved:  -->
<!-- - *most--favoured--nation* principle, meaning that trade benefits conferred on one country should be extended unconditionally to all other member countries;  -->
<!-- - *national treatment*, meaning that imports should be treated no less favourably than domestic products; and  -->
<!-- - *reciprocity*, meaning that negotiations should be conducted on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis. -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Agriculture in the Trade Negotiations</h2>
<p>Idea of replacing agricultural price support with direct payments to farmers decoupled from production dates back to the late 1950s. Twelfth session of the GATT Contracting Parties selected a Panel of Experts, chaired by Gottfried Haberler, to examine the effect of agricultural protectionism, fluctuating commodity prices, and the failure of export earnings to keep pace with import demand in low and middle income countries. The report (1958) found that there was a decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities (relative to the manufactured goods).</p>
<p>This finding accords with what later became to be known as the <em>Prebisch–Singer hypothesis</em> (though Haberler himself had particular disagreement was with the idea that there was a systematic long-term decline in the terms of trade). The report stressed the importance of minimizing the effect of agriculture subsidies on competitiveness; recommended replacing price support with direct supplementary payments not linked with production; anticipated discussion on green box subsidies—the kind of subsidies that do not distort trade, or at most cause minimal distortion; that are government-funded (not by charging consumers higher prices); and that do not involve price support.</p>
<p>In 1980s, global economy had entered a cycle of recession, which led to a collapse of agricultural commodity prices. Financial and economic costs of agricultural policies rose sharply in many industrialized countries. Budget costs, shrinking foreign demand, and world surpluses that threatened a global trade war, coupled with the perception opening up markets could improve economic conditions, and generate much needed efficiency gains, forced agricultural issues to the top of the GATT agenda in the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<div id="uruguay-round" class="section level3" number="5.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Uruguay Round</h3>
<p>The Uruguay Round negotiations highlighted the disparities in the ways they envisaged trade policy among high income countries and between high income and low and middle income countries. The negotiations also illustrated the diversity of interests among low and middle income countries: net exporting countries were concerned about market access and effects of export subsidies available in high income countries; net importing countries, were in addition concerned about possible rising prices in world markets, particularly for food grains.</p>
<p>Agreement on Agriculture, which was reached in the third and final phase of the Uruguay Round, continues to be the most substantial trade liberalization agreement in agricultural products in the history of trade negotiations. The agreement revolved around the following three key directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market access - non-tariff barriers to be converted into tariff equivalents; where necessary, minimum access to domestic markets to be guaranteed through the creation of tariff-rate quotas; provisions to be introduced to safeguard importers against import surges and low world prices.</li>
<li>Export competition - export subsidies to be capped and then reduced in both value and volume.</li>
<li>Domestic support - the degree of the sector-wide support—better known as the aggregate measurement of support— to be reduced over time (more sharply and swiftly for high income countries than for low and middle income countries).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="doha-round" class="section level3" number="5.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Doha Round</h3>
<p>In a 2001 meeting in Doha, Qatar, high income countries agreed to prioritize the issue of export subsidies. Subsequently, in a 2003 ministerial-level WTO meeting in Mexico, a group of 21 low and middle income countries requested tighter domestic support restrictions for high income countries, and more flexibility for special and differential treatment for low and middle income countries. While the agreement was not reached, the meeting went down in history as the first credible attempt by a group of low and middle income countries to affect the outcome of multilateral negotiations.</p>
<p>In July 2008, Doha Round negotiations broke down over agricultural trade issues, which involved a mechanism that would allow low income countries to impose tariffs for specific products if prices of these products were to decrease sharply, or if there were to be a surge in imports. In December 2013, in restarted negotiations, a partial agreement was reached on issues such as simplifying customs procedures. The agreement to relax major agricultural trade constraints was minimal, however. Indeed, the conclusion of the Doha Round may have marked the end of significant progress in global multilateral trade liberalization for the foreseeable future.</p>
