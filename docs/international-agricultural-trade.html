<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> International Agricultural Trade</h1>
<p>Countries trade because some can produce certain commodities when others cannot (absolute advantage), or, more typically, because some can produce certain commodities more efficiently than others (comparative advantage). <em>Spatial equilibrium models</em> can help determine the optimum trading patterns, given the supply and demand conditions within each country (market).</p>
<p>In absence of transfer costs, the intersection of the excess demand and excess supply curves yields the world price. A more realistic scenario is trade with transfer costs. A way to think of the effect of transfer costs is by incorporating them into the supply function of the exporting country.</p>
<p>Transfer costs increase the price at which commodities are traded, and reduce the quantity of traded commodities. As a result, in an importing market, consumers receive less of the commodity for a higher price, and producers sell more of the commodity for a higher price; the opposite is true in an exporting market.</p>
<div id="gains-from-trade" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Gains from Trade</h2>
<p>Gains from trade can be grouped into two categories: gains from exchange, and gains from specialization.</p>
<p>Drawing supplies from a world market allows access to a wider array of products at usually lower cost and perhaps with greater security of supply than can be produced by domestic industries. Lower prices from imported goods allow consumers to buy more goods from disposable income. Price benefits also for raw materials used to produce final goods, lowering price of these final goods. As incomes rise, savings will increase, which will lead to increased investment and greater economic growth.</p>
<p>Trade will stimulate investment in and expansion of low cost industries (and will force contraction of high cost industries). Increase of the size of the market allows firms or industry to take advantage of economies of scale. Increase of competition provides greater emphasis on technological development and innovation, and results in increased skills of workforce.</p>
<!-- ## Patterns of Trade -->
<!-- If resources were to be transferred easily from one country to another, incentive for international trade could disappear. But technology, capital and people do move (albeit gradually) among nations. This changes relative costs and comparative advantage, and subsequently---patterns of trade over time. Changes to transfer costs (e.g., increase in fuel costs) can also diminish trade. Inter-annual weather fluctuation can have transitory effect on trade patterns as well. -->
</div>
<div id="trade-liberalization-vs-protectionism" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Trade Liberalization vs Protectionism</h2>
<p>The case for free trade is that producers and consumers allocate resources most efficiently when governments do not distort market prices through trade policy. Economic welfare of a small country is highest with free trade. With restricted trade: consumers pay higher prices (than they would have paid otehrwise); distorted prices cause overproduction either by existing firms producing more or by more firms entering the market.</p>
<!-- Where tariff rates are already low, benefits of moving to free trade are only a small fraction of national income for most countries. For some countries, in some time periods, the cost of protectionism can be substantial. -->
<p>Protectionism consists of set of actions that deviates the trade patterns from what would have been their state in absence of any regulations (i.e., in a free trade regime). The case for protectionism is primarily directed to maintain a considerable degree of self–sufficiency in the country, but can also be ‘re-active’ to ongoing economic or political processes. Common levers for trade restriction are tariffs and quotas. Other government interventions that can play the role of trade distortions are taxes and subsidies.</p>
<p>In agriculture, strongly divergent climatic conditions around the globe, create ideal conditions for making use of comparative advantage. And while it would seem that free trade should be particularly attractive and relevant in agriculture, it has been traditionally an area where governments have been reluctant to open up domestic markets to international trade. Typical pattern is that developed countries tend to maintain high domestic prices, to protect farmers’ incomes, while developing countries tend to keep domestic prices low, in the interest of consumers.</p>
<!-- ## Terms of Trade -->
<!-- Terms of trade denotes export prices in terms of import prices. A large country can alter terms of trade in their favor by means of trade restrictions (e.g., tariffs or quotas) or equivalent trade distortion mechanisms (e.g., taxes). The welfare effect of this is nonlinear, however. That is, a small tariff may lead to an increase in national welfare, but at some tariff rate, the welfare will begin to decrease as the economic efficiency loss exceeds the terms of trade gain. Likewise, an export tax that completely prohibits exports leaves a country worse off; but an export tax rate may exist that maximizes national welfare through the terms of trade. The foregoing ignore likelihood that other countries may retaliate against the large country by enacting their own trade restrictions. -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Trade Negotiations and GATT</h2>
<p>After the World War II, nations around the world recognized the urgent need for coordinated policy efforts in the area of international trade. With that in mind, 23 nations signed a multilateral agreement regulating international trade known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva on 30 October 1947. GATT took effect on 1 January 1948, and became the vehicle for trade negotiations for the next half century, until its successor—the World Trade Organization (WTO) was formed and took effect in 1995.</p>
<p>Main principles of the GATT involved: (i) <em>most–favored–nation treatment</em>, meaning that trade benefits conferred on one country should be extended unconditionally to all other member countries; (ii) <em>national treatment</em>, meaning that imports should be treated no less favorably than domestic products; and (iii) <em>reciprocity</em>, meaning that negotiations should be conducted on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.</p>
<div id="runup-to-uruguay-round" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Run–Up to Uruguay Round</h3>
<p>Idea of replacing agricultural price support with direct payments to farmers decoupled from production dates back to the late 1950s. Twelfth session of the GATT Contracting Parties selected a Panel of Experts chaired by Gottfried Haberler to examine the effect of agricultural protectionism, fluctuating commodity prices, and the failure of export earnings to keep pace with import demand in developing countries. Haberler Report (1958) stressed the importance of minimizing the effect of agriculture subsidies on competitiveness; recommended replacing price support with direct supplementary payments not linked with production; anticipated discussion on green box subsidies.</p>
<p>In 1980s, global economy had entered a cycle of recession, which led to a collapse of agricultural commodity prices. Financial and economic costs of agricultural policies rose sharply in many industrialized countries. Perception that opening up markets could improve economic conditions, and generate much needed efficiency gains, facilitated a new round of multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<p>In leading up to the 1986 negotiations, developed countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture. This opposition was subsequently neutralized by guaranteeing farmers continued support, and allowing subsidies that cause not more than minimal trade distortion in order to meet public policy aims. At the same time, a group of fourteen mostly small and medium-sized agricultural exporters, better known as the ‘Cairns Group,’ emerged as an opposition to agricultural protectionism by U.S. and E.U.</p>
</div>
<div id="uruguay-round" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Uruguay Round</h3>
<p>Hopes of expanding the GATT to important new areas such as services capital intellectual property textiles and agriculture. 123 countries, which included actively involved developing countries. Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round continues to be the most substantial trade liberalization agreement in agricultural products in the history of trade negotiations. The goals of the agreement were to improve market access for agricultural products; eliminate export subsidies on agricultural products; reduce domestic support of agriculture in the form of price-distorting subsidies and quotas.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the agricultural talks (1987), the U.S. suggested a complete phase-out over 10 years of all agricultural subsidies and import barriers. The Cairns Group proposed an approach comparable to that of the U.S. The E.U. preferred to rather deal with short–term issues, however. Japan, though receptive of a prohibition of export subsidies, saw no point in reducing internal support.</p>
<p>In the second phase (1989), the U.S. proposal still envisaged an eventual elimination of export subsidies as well as trade–distorting domestic subsidies. The U.S. also introduced the concept of ``tariffication’’ of non–tariff barierrs, with an ultimate goal of reducing (though not eliminating) the tariffs over time. The E.U. reluctantly (and conditionally) agreed to consider the tariffication option, but the agreement was not reached at the end.</p>
<p>In the third and final phase (1991), fundamental reforms were proposed to be put in place, which allowed the E.U. to accept the reduction commitments on export subsidies. After further negotiations on various elements, the agreement was finally reached among the involved parties.</p>
<p>Market access: bind all tariffs in agriculture; convert of all existing non-tariffs into bound duties; reduce tariffs by 36%, with a minimum rate of reduction of 15% for each tariff lines; safeguard provisions to allow importers to guard against import surges and low world prices.</p>
<p>Export competition: reduction in expenditure on export subsidies by 36%, reduction in the quantity of subsidized exports by 21% during the implementation period.</p>
<p>Domestic support: reduction of the level of sector–wide (rather than product–specific) support—better known as the aggregate measurement of support (AMS)—by 20% during the implementation period.</p>
