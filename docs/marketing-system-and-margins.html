<p>When we enjoy our pizza at a restaurant, or an oven roasted chicken at home, rarely (if at all) we contemplate about the chain of events—a system, and the actions of people involved in this system—that has brought the meal to our table. This <em>agricultural marketing system</em>, also known as the <em>food system</em>, links producers with consumers by transforming an agricultural commodity into a food product.</p>

</h2>
<p>Although farmers and consumers sometimes directly interact (e.g., farmers markets), most food products usually go through a complex processing and distribution system after they leave the farm-gate and before they land on a shelf of a retail store. Marketing transforms products over time, space, and form through storage, transportation, and processing. In the process, the usually bulky, perishable, and homogeneous farm commodities are transformed into more concentrated, storable, and differentiated food products.</p>
<p>The agricultural marketing system consists of multiple stages, and involves a number of intermediaries, such as processors, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. Between each stage of the system there is a market. Within each market a price is determined. Prices aggregate a great deal of information, and play an integral role in conveying this information between food consumers and commodity producers.</p>
<p>The longer and more complex is the marketing system, the more difficult it becomes to relay information from a consumer to a farmer. A profit-maximizing farmer will only supply a better quality commodity, or add a certain attribute to the commodity, if they are rewarded for it. When the reward exceeds costs, the farmer will take actions to supply a commodity with desired qualities. In presence of uncertainty surrounding the rewards (prices), as well as information asymmetry among buyers and sellers within the marketing system, ensuring that the desired product attributes are present for the right price may be a challenging (if not an impossible) task.</p>
<p>The demand for a well-functioning marketing system is stronger in higher-income, urbanized societies. Where high proportion of the population lives on farms and is more or less self-sufficient, the demand for agricultural marketing services in limited, which typically leads to an inefficient marketing system. An inefficient marketing system usually is accompanied by infrastructure deficiencies, limited or no access to information, and, in some instances, government-induced market distortions.</p>

</h2>
<p>One way to facilitate a coordinated performance among members of the supply chain is by means of contracting. A contract is an arrangement between a buyer and a seller, where the parties agree on quantity and price of a commodity to be exchanged months in advance. There are different degrees of ‘involvement’ in contractual agreements; in more ‘involved’ instances, a processor supplies all the inputs, and assumes market risks, while a farmer supplies farm facilities and is responsible for agreed-upon commodity production.</p>
<p>At the extreme, two or more segments of a supply chain go under the same ownership, which is referred to as <em>vertical integration</em>. Downstream integration is when a firm begins producing inputs that they previously purchased from their supplier. Upstream integration is when a firm begins performing a function of a firm that previously purchased their product.</p>
<p>Among the key benefits of vertical integration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower transaction costs;</li>
<li>improved risk management;</li>
<li>increased efficiency in resource allocation, production, and distribution.</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>In the farm-retail price relationship, the difference between what consumers pay and what farmers receive is called <em>price spread</em>, also known as <em>marketing margin</em>. Consider a profit maximizing retailer, which uses a farm commodity and marketing services as inputs in production. The profit function of this retailer can be given by: <span class="math inline">\(\pi = p^r q^r - p^f q^f - c^r(q^r)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p^r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p^f\)</span> are retail and farm prices; <span class="math inline">\(q^r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q^f\)</span> are product output and commodity input quantities; and the last term, <span class="math inline">\(c^r(q^r)\)</span>, represents the retailer’s marketing cost function.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let <span class="math inline">\(q^r=q^f=q\)</span>, which reduces the profit function to: <span class="math inline">\(\pi = (p^r - p^f) q - c^r(q)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p^r - p^f\)</span> is the price spread.</p>
<p>Marketing costs, <span class="math inline">\(c^r(q)\)</span> can be modeled as a linear function of quantity produced: <span class="math display">\[C^r(q) = \delta^r q,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta^r &gt; 0\)</span> is a constant. In such case, marginal marketing cost is the same for any <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial c^r(q)}{\partial q} = \delta^r.\]</span> This model is consistent with a simple markup rule: the retail price is equal to the wholesale price plus a constant (which is based on the cost of the marketing inputs).</p>
<p>Alternatively, and perhaps more realistically, marketing costs can be modeled, as nonlinear function of quantity produced. The usual assumption, in that case, would be that the first derivative of the marketing costs function should be positive, while the second derivative can be positive or negative (i.e., marketing costs should be increasing with output, but they may be increasing at an increasing rate or a decreasing rate).</p>
<p>Because of a complex marketing system, variables other than just prices and quantities of inputs and outputs may be important in determining the margins. Some of such factors include changes in cost of the marketing services that get the farm product to the consumer in the form they demand (e.g., improvements in technology in the marketing system); changes in factor composition, over time, that may increase the total cost of marketing services (e.g., additional marketing services can emerge, that were not available or feasible before); changes in government programs (e.g., taxes and subsidies); changes in market power of firms in the marketing system, resulting in: increased prices paid by a consumer, or reduced prices received by a farmer (or both).</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Elasticity of Derived Demand<div class="tooltip"><button class="internal-link-btn" onclick="copy_link('elasticity-of-derived-demand')" onmouseout="reset_tooltip('elasticity-of-derived-demand-tooltip')"><span class="tooltiptext" id="elasticity-of-derived-demand-tooltip">Copy link</span><i class="fa fa-link"></i></button></div>
</h2>
<p>Assuming linear demand functions, and constant marketing costs, elasticity of derived demand (faced by a farmer) can be given by: <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^f = \epsilon^r\frac{p^f}{p^r}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^r\)</span> is elasticity of primary demand (in a retail market), and <span class="math inline">\(p^f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p^r\)</span> are the farm commodity and the retail product prices. It follows that the farm-level demand is more price inelastic than the retail demand. The larger is the marketing margin the larger is the difference between the two elasticities to the point that even though the retail demand is price elastic, the derived demand may end up being price inelastic.</p>

<li>Consider an economy with a single farmer and a single retailer. Suppose the farmer produces a commodity with a cost function of <span class="math inline">\(c(q) = 10q+q^2\)</span>. Suppose the retailer buys this commodity from the farmer and processes it to a food product available to consumers. The retailer’s processing (or marketing) cost function is <span class="math inline">\(m(q) = 0.5q^2\)</span>. Suppose the market demand for this food product is <span class="math inline">\(p=110-q\)</span>. Obtain the marketing margin and the market equilibrium price elasticities of demand that the retailer and the farmer face.</li>
<li>Consider the same cost functions and the market demand as in the previous question. But suppose the retailer decided to exercise the monopoly power. Obtain the marketing margin, the monopoly markup, and the market equilibrium price elasticities of demand for the retailer and the farmer.</li>
