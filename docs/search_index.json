This system, known as the food system, is rather complex. It links farmers with consumers by transforming an agricultural commodity into a food product. The activities that facilitate this transformation can be tangible (e.g., storage, transportation, processing) or intangible (e.g., grading, risk-bearing, financing); but they all add value to agricultural commodities at different stages of the supply chain. The supply chain members play a crucial role in food systems, as their activities, on one end, are linked to farmers, and on the other end they closely monitor, and sometimes influence, consumer preferences. Although farmers and consumers sometimes directly interact (e.g., farmers markets), most food products usually go through a complex processing and distribution system after they leave the farm-gate and before they land on a shelf. During this process, bulky, perishable, and homogeneous farm commodities are transformed into concentrated, storable, and differentiated products, made available to consumers at retail stores. As a result, the farm-value share of a commodity decreases. This decrease varies across commodities, and depends on value added during the processing and distribution stages. 3.2 Vertical Coordination The supply chain often involves a number of intermediaries, such as processors, wholesalers, and retailers. These intermediaries manifest the division of labor and facilitate specialization; as such, their actions usually are marked by economies of scale. The intermediaries also help mitigate the search and transaction costs. The longer the supply chain, the more difficult it becomes to relay information from the consumer to the farmer. A profit-maximizing farmer will only supply a better quality commodity, if they are rewarded for it. One way to facilitate this is via the so-called grid pricing mechanism. Grid pricing relies on market to determine the ‘base price’ of a product, and then assigns premiums and discounts to it, based on the value consumers place on different quality characteristics. As such, farmers are rewarded for producing a better quality commodity, and as long as the reward exceeds costs, they will take actions to supply such a commodity. Another form of vertical coordination is contracting. A contract is an arrangement between a processor and a farmer, where the parties agree on quantity and price of a farm commodity to be exchanged months in advance. In a more ‘involved’ variant of contracting, a processor supplies all the inputs, and assumes market risks, while a farmer supplies farm facilities and is responsible for agreed-upon commodity production. Vertical integration is a process by which two or more segments of the supply chain are under the same ownership. Downstream integration is when a firm begins producing inputs that they previously purchased from their supplier. Upstream integration is when a firm begins performing a function of a firm that previously purchased their product. "],
