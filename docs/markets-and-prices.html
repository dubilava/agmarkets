<div id="choice-and-individual-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Choice and Individual Demand</h2>
<p>A consumer at any given time faces an array of choices. These choices are linked with their <em>needs</em>. Ideally, the consumer would like to satisfy all of these needs, but their choices are constrained by their disposable income—the budget allocated for purchasing goods. The objective of a consumer, then, is to select a subset of goods that <em>best</em> satisfy their needs, subject to their budget constraint.</p>
<p>Economists define “best” in terms of consumers’ attempts to maximize their <em>utility</em>. Utility is an economic term describing satisfaction from the consumption of goods. While it is a unit-free measure, in general, more utility is better than less utility, and positive utility is “good” and negative utility is “bad.”</p>
<p>Mathematically, for a set (or a basket) of goods, given by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&#39;\)</span>, the utility approach to the theory of demand is given by: <span class="math display">\[\max U(\mathbf{x}),\;~~s.t.\;~\mathbf{p}&#39;\mathbf{x} \leq M,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}=(p_1,\ldots,p_n)&#39;\)</span> is a vector of prices for the given set of goods, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the total disposable income (i.e., the budget). Thus, a consumer tries to attain the maximum utility they can afford, given their income and the prices of goods. The following graph illustrates this for a scenario with two goods.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Market determines prices of goods—i.e., a consumer has no control over the prices. Changes to prices affect a consumer’s decision–making. A consumer can afford and, typically, will purchase more of the same good as the price of the good drops. This is known as the <em>substitution effect</em>. The substitution effect is always inversely related to the price change.</p>
<p>Moreover, a decrease in price of a good, in effect, is equivalent to an increase in income—a consumer can afford more of all goods with the same amount of money. This is known as the <em>income effect</em>. The income effect, usually (but not necessarily), is inversely related to the price change.</p>
<p>Thus, a price drop will typically increase the quantity demanded due to the income effect as well as the substitution effect.</p>
<p>For some goods, real income and demand are inversely related. This is equivalent to the negative income effect due to price decrease. Such goods are called <em>inferior goods</em>. For inferior goods, the income and the substitution effects have opposite signs.</p>
<p>At the extreme, the income effect might outweigh the substitution effect, resulting in a positively sloped demand curve. This is known as <em>Giffen’s paradox</em>, and such goods are referred to as the <em>Giffen goods</em>. It might occur, for example, when a staple commodity, such as rice, constitutes a large portion of consumer’s expenditures.</p>
</div>
<div id="market-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Market Demand</h2>
<p>We obtain aggregate or market demand when we add up (horizontally) individual consumer demand functions. Market demand is a schedule of product quantities that all consumers in a market are willing to purchase at given prices, everything else held constant. Normally, the demand curve is downward sloping, which is inferred in the <em>law of demand</em>.</p>
<p>Own price of the good is a sole factor affecting the quantity demanded, which results in <em>movement along the demand curve</em>. All other factors may influence demand by <em>shifting the demand curve</em>. These factors can be economic (e.g., prices and availability of other goods and services, income and its distribution); demographic (population size and its distribution by age, gender, ethnicity, etc.); tastes and preferences (influenced by information and advertising, lifestyle, etc.).</p>
<div id="demand-elasticities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Demand Elasticities</h3>
<p>The responsiveness of quantity demanded to a price change—known as the own–price elasticity of demand (demand elasticity)—may vary from product to product, over time, and across locations. For example, quantity of salt purchased will not vary greatly due to the price change, but quantity of bananas purchased will likely be more responsive to price changes. From the consumers’ standpoint: bananas have substitutes, but salt doesn’t. As another example, quantity of rice purchased is likely to be less responsive to price changes in Asian countries, where it is considered a staple food, than in the Western world, where rice is viewed more as a side dish, perhaps with more substitutes.</p>
<p>Mathematically, price elasticity is given by: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon = \frac{\partial Q}{Q}/\frac{\partial P}{P},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> denotes an infinitesimal change. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial X}{X} \equiv \%\Delta X\)</span>, and so price elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity relative to the percentage change in price. That the elasticity is measured in relative (or percentage) terms, makes it an attractive measure as it facilitates a direct comparison between goods with possibly different units of measurement of quantities and prices.</p>
<p>The foregoing equation can be rewritten as: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\)</span> is the slope of the demand curve. Because of the downward-sloping demand curve, the price elasticity measure ranges from zero to negative infinity. This range consists of <em>inelastic</em> (<span class="math inline">\(|\epsilon_{ii}| &lt; 1\)</span>) and <em>elastic</em> (<span class="math inline">\(|\epsilon_{ii}| &gt; 1\)</span>) segments, with <span class="math inline">\(|\epsilon_{ii}| = 1\)</span> representing the <em>unitary elastic</em> case.</p>
<p>For most functional forms, including the linear demand, the elasticity coefficient varies along the demand curve. Exceptions are if demand is represented by a straight horizontal line, a straight vertical line, a power function, and a rectangular hyperbola. In general, however, demand for different goods is usually categorized as elastic or inelastic.</p>
<p>The responsiveness of the demand for a good <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to a price changes of a related good <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is known as the cross–price elasticity of demand (cross–price elasticity). Mathematically, cross-price elasticity is given by: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{ij} = \frac{\partial Q_i}{Q_i}/\frac{\partial P_j}{P_j},\]</span> or, alternatively: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{ij} = \frac{\partial Q_i}{\partial P_j}\frac{P_j}{Q_i}\]</span></p>
<p>Three types of relationships—which are related to the substitution effect—can be identified depending on the sign of cross-price elasticity: for substitute goods, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij} &gt; 0\)</span>; for complement goods, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij} &lt; 0\)</span>; and for independent goods, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij} = 0\)</span></p>
<p>Note that the price change also facilitates the income effect. If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, we might observe a negative relationship between the demand for product <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the change in price of product <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, even when the two are substitutes. To the extent that the expenditure share of a given good is a small fraction of the disposable income, the substitution effect will typically dominate the income effect.</p>
<p>The responsiveness of the demand for a good to income changes is income elasticity of demand (income elasticity). Mathematically, income elasticity is given by: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{m} = \frac{\partial Q}{Q}/\frac{\partial M}{M},\]</span> or, alternatively: <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{m} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial M}\frac{M}{Q}\]</span></p>
<p>In most cases, the income elasticity of demand has a positive value: as income increases, consumers tend to buy more of most products. However, income elasticities tend to decline as incomes increase. In general, demand is thought to be a nonlinear function of income. In practice, expenditures (rather than income) are often used to estimate “income” elasticities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="supply-by-a-single-firm" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Supply by a Single Firm</h2>
<p>Much like consumers are utility–maximizers, the firms are profit–maximizers. For a firm producing a product, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, using a set of inputs, <span class="math inline">\(z=(z_1,\ldots,z_k)&#39;\)</span> , the short-run profit is defined as: <span class="math display">\[\pi = pq-w&#39;z,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a unit price of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(w=(w_1,\ldots,w_k)\)</span> is a vector imput costs.</p>
<p>A firm’s output is related to the inputs through a production function: <span class="math display">\[q = q(z)\]</span></p>
<p>The profit function, thus, can be rewritten as: <span class="math display">\[\pi = pq(z)-w&#39;z.\]</span> This equation can be used in deriving the producer’s supply function of output and demand functions for inputs.
<!-- The relevant supply function depends on the form of the production function, hence the form of the cost functions. --></p>
<p>A producer maximizes profits by using each factor up to the point where the last unit just pays for itself. Optimal use of input is determined with respect to the (known) production function. The functional form of production is such that output is increasing with input, but at a decreasing rate. The rate of increase in output is called the <em>marginal (physical) product</em> of input: <span class="math display">\[MP_i=\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i}\]</span></p>
<p>Following the rule of profit maximization, the optimum level of factor use is at the point where the <span class="math inline">\(MP_i\)</span> multiplied by price of output, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, just equals to the unit cost of input, <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>, which yields the following relationship:<span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i} = \frac{w_i}{p}\]</span></p>
<p>This relationship implies that an increase of the input cost, will lead to reduced use of that input and lower output, everything else held constant. Moreover, optimal factor use will change only with an increase or decrease in relative prices.</p>
</div>
<div id="market-supply" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Market Supply</h2>
<p>Market supply is a (horizontal) aggregate of individual firm’s supply curves. Assuming <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> identical firms, each producing <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> units of optimal output, the aggregate market supply is <span class="math inline">\(Q = nq\)</span>. The supply curve, generally, is upward sloping, which is inferred in the <em>law of supply</em>.</p>
<p>Own price of a good is a sole factor affecting the quantity supplied resulting in the movement along the supply curve. All other factors affect supply by <em>shifting the supply curve</em>. Such factors can be: prices of inputs; prices of related goods; goods competing for the same factors of production (e.g., the same land for corn and soybeans); joint production of goods (e.g., soybean meal and soybean oil); factors affecting production costs and output quantities (e.g., technology and weather); production risks; taxes and subsidies, etc.</p>
<div id="supply-elasticity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Supply Elasticity</h3>
<p>The responsiveness of the supply to price changes is known as <em>price elasticity of supply</em> (supply elasticity). Mathematically, supply elasticity is given by: <span class="math display">\[\eta = \frac{\partial Q}{Q}/\frac{\partial P}{P} \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q}\]</span></p>
<p>In the very short run, supply is perfectly inelastic (vertical line) and the elasticity is zero. Inelastic supply refers to elasticity measures between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Elastic supply refers to elasticity measures greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. A perfectly elastic supply (horizontal line) has the elasticity measure or <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming a linear supply curve, as quantity and price increase (i.e., as we move upwards along the supply curve) the price elasticity of supply converges to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Moreover, if a linear supply curve intersects with the origin, the elasticity of supply is always <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<div id="market-structure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Market Structure</h2>
<div id="perfect-competition" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Perfect Competition</h3>
<p>To begin, we assume that there are many sellers and buyers in a market, and that each individual seller or buyer cannot influence the market. Furthermore, we assume that the product is homogenous, that there are no costs associated with entering and leaving the market, and that the information on economic forces that are determining prices is complete and freely available for market participants. Such market is referred to as a perfectly competitive market.</p>
<p>A perfectly competitive market is efficient, in that the market equilibrium leads to the socially optimal outcome. Such markets only exist in theory, however, as one or several assumptions of a perfectly competitive market are usually violated.</p>
</div>
<div id="monopoly" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2</span> Monopoly</h3>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have a monopoly (or a monopsony). In the case of a monopoly, we have a single seller (in the case of a monopsony we have a single buyer). The product homogeneity assumption is automatically met. However, there are very high costs associated with entering the market.</p>
<p>A monopolist, unlike a competitive firm, is no longer a price-taker; instead, they can ‘manipulate’ quantity demanded by changing prices, or (equivalently) they can manipulate market prices by changing their output. Market equilibrium under monopoly leads to an inefficient outcome, as some of the surplus - which would have been attained under a perfectly competitive market - is lost; this is known as the <em>dead-weight loss</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="oligopoly" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.5.3</span> Oligopoly</h3>
<p>In-between of a perfectly competitive market and a monopoly (or a monopsony) we have oligopoly (or oligopsony), which means several sellers (or buyers) on the market.</p>
<p>If these sellers collude, the market outcome under oligopoly can be identical to that under monopoly. Even if they do not collude, but act strategically, they can still extract additional surplus from consumers, also leading to an inefficient outcome and the dead-weight loss (albeit not as large as that under monopoly). In some instances - e.g., if oligopolists engage in a ‘price war’ - the resulted market equilibrium can be similar to that under a perfectly competitive market.</p>
