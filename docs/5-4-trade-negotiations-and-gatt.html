<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Trade Negotiations and GATT</h2>
<p>During World War II, there was recognition of the need for coordinated policy efforts in area of international trade. Bretton Woods Agreement 1944 focused on needs of developed countries, and involved formation of The International Monetary Fund, and The World Bank. But in 1948, the U.S. Congress rejected the proposed International Trade Organization. Subsequently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was formed in 1995; until then, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) became the vehicle for trade negotiations.</p>
<p>GATT was a multilateral agreement regulating international trade. Signed by 23 nations in Geneva on 30 October 1947, GATT took effect on 1 January 1948. It lasted until the signature by 123 nations in Marrakesh on 14 April 1994 of the Uruguay Round Agreements established the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 1 January 1995.</p>
<p>Main principles involved: most–favored–nation treatment: trade benefits conferred on one country should be extended unconditionally to all other suppliers; national treatment: imports should be treated no less favorably than domestic products; elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports; tariffs as the only means of protection; reciprocity: negotiations should be conducted on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.</p>
<p>In agriculture, strongly divergent climatic conditions around the globe, create ideal conditions for making use of comparative advantage. And while it would seem that free trade should be particularly attractive and relevant in agriculture, it has been traditionally an area where governments have been reluctant to open up domestic markets to international trade. Typical pattern is that developed countries tend to maintain high domestic prices, to protect farmers’ incomes, while developing countries tend to keep domestic prices low, in the interest of consumers.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Run–Up to Uruguay Round</h3>
<p>Idea of replacing agricultural price support with direct payments to farmers decoupled from production dates back to the late 1950s. Twelfth session of the GATT Contracting Parties selected a Panel of Experts chaired by Gottfried Haberler to examine the effect of: agricultural protectionism; fluctuating commodity prices; and the failure of export earnings to keep pace with import demand in developing countries. Haberler Report (1958): stressed the importance of minimizing the effect of agriculture subsidies on competitiveness;recommended replacing price support with direct supplementary payments not linked with production; anticipated discussion on green box subsidies.</p>
<p>In 1980s, global economy had entered a cycle of recession, which led to a collapse of agricultural commodity prices. Financial and economic costs of agricultural policies rose sharply in many industrialized countries. Perception that opening up markets could improve economic conditions, and generate much needed efficiency gains, facilitated a new round of multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<p>In leading up to the 1986 negotiations, developed countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture; this opposition was subsequently neutralized by guaranteeing farmers continued support, and allowing subsidies that cause <code>not more than minimal trade distortion'' in order to meet public policy aims. At the same time, a group of fourteen mostly small and medium-sized agricultural exporters, better known as the</code>Cairns Group’’, emerged as an opposition to agricultural protectionism by U.S. and E.U.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Uruguay Round</h3>
<p>Hopes of expanding the GATT to important new areas such as services capital intellectual property textiles and agriculture. 123 countries, which included actively involved developing countries. Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round continues to be the most substantial trade liberalization agreement in agricultural products in the history of trade negotiations. The goals of the agreement were to: improve market access for agricultural products; eliminate export subsidies on agricultural products; reduce domestic support of agriculture in the form of price-distorting subsidies and quotas.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the agricultural talks (1987), the U.S. suggested a complete phase-out over 10 years of all agricultural subsidies and import barriers. The Cairns Group proposed an approach comparable to that of the U.S. The E.U. preferred to rather deal with short–term issues, however. Japan, though receptive of a prohibition of export subsidies, saw no point in reducing internal support.</p>
<p>In the second phase (1989), the U.S. proposal still envisaged an eventual elimination of export subsidies as well as trade–distorting domestic subsidies. The U.S. also introduced the concept of ``tariffication’’ of non–tariff barierrs, with an ultimate goal of reducing (though not eliminating) the tariffs over time. The E.U. reluctantly (and conditionally) agreed to consider the tariffication option, but the agreement was not reached at the end.</p>
<p>In the third and final phase (1991), fundamental reforms were proposed to be put in place, which allowed the E.U. to accept the reduction commitments on export subsidies. After further negotiations on various elements, the agreement was finally reached among the involved parties.</p>
<p>Market access: bind all tariffs in agriculture; convert of all existing non-tariffs into bound duties; reduce tariffs by 36%, with a minimum rate of reduction of 15% for each tariff lines; safeguard provisions to allow importers to guard against import surges and low world prices.</p>
<p>Export competition: reduction in expenditure on export subsidies by 36%, reduction in the quantity of subsidized exports by 21% during the implementation period.</p>
<p>Domestic support: reduction of the level of sector–wide (rather than product–specific) support—better known as the aggregate measurement of support (AMS)—by 20% during the implementation period.</p>
